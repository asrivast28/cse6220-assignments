# CSE 6220 - Programming Assignments

This repository contains my solutions for all the programming assignments which were part of the course High Performance Computing. All the solutions were implemented using MPI.

* [Assignment 1](prog1/) - Used master-worker paradigm for calculating Hamming distance between integers
* [Assignment 2](prog2/) - Parallelized Jacobi method for finding the solution of a system of linear equations
* [Assignment 3](prog3/) - Parallelized quick sort
