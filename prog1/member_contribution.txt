Description
-----------
Both the team members contributed to the development of algorithms, running the
experiments, analysis of results, report writing, etc. equally.

Even though the code development was also collaborative, making it hard to
assign credit to a single team member, following broad distribution of work
can be made:
* Cansu implemented the sequential part of the algorithm, hamming function, as
  well as the algorithms in workers, starting from a partial solution.
* Ankit implemented the algorithm in master and the communication and
  computation overlap related changes.
