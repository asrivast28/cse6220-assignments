Description
-----------
Both the team members contributed to the development of algorithms, running the
experiments, analysis of results, report writing, etc. equally.

Even though the code development was also collaborative, making it hard to
assign credit to a single team member, following broad distribution of work
can be made:
* Ankit implemented the sequential Jacobi algorithm and helped with debugging
  the parallel implementation.
* Cansu implemented the parallel Jacobi and all the helper functions.
